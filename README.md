Audio Player app
=====================
The goal of this project is to build an Android Application that plays music which is stored on the device, and has the possibility to create playlists.

List of features:
  - list of the available audio files on the device, sortable by name, artist, album, etc.
  - list of custom playlists, and option to create a new playlist
  - a view of the song currently playing and the options to stop, pause and resume the song
  - buttons for playing previous and next song in the playlist
  - continues playing the music when app is in background (e.g. when the user locks the screen)
  - notification with the currently playing song info (name, artist, album, etc.)
  - pause the music if external speakers are disconnected (for instance when the earphones are accidentally plugged out, the music must not continue over the device speakers)
  - while playing music, the app should still be able to be used for viewing the songs and playlist, create new playlists, select a new song, etc.
